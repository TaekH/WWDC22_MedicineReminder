## ðŸ“„ About 'MedicineReminder'
> Medicine Reminder is an application for elderly people who often forget to take medicine.

To make it very easy to use, you can tap the big pill button to check that you have taken the medicine.

There is a MedicineInput page for writing information about the medication
This page may be difficult for the elderly to fill out, so only the doctors and guardians must fill out the form
You can check the type, number of medicines, number of doses per day, and the date of treatment.

I hope the elderly will take a step toward their health through this application
